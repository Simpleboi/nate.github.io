      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Derrick, highly focused and ambitious, from Houston, Texas.
        I bring a rich background of intermediate software engineering,
        encompassing two years of hands-on experience in Python and C++,
        soon to include a web development skill set with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        If I'm not programming applications, I'm programming music.
        My passion for dissecting video game mechanics and learning new ways
        to transform my musical sound keeps me going, no matter how difficult it may get.
        I'm on a dual journey to obtain loyal fans and craft a community-adored game engine.
        Join me as I weave programming and music into the fabric of my
        evolving professional identity.</p>
